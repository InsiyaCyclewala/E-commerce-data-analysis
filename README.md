# Language Detection 
Ever wondered how platforms like Google Translate detect a language just from a few words? I built a Language Detection Model that does exactly that! 
ðŸ”¹ What It Does:
 Simply input any sentence, and the model predicts which language it belongs to! 
ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack:
 Dataset: Kaggle
 Algorithm: NaÃ¯ve Bayes
 Feature Extraction: CountVectorizer
 Accuracy: 98% 
ðŸ”¹ Key Takeaways:
 Training the model was straightforward, and I was amazed at how well it generalizes across different languages!
